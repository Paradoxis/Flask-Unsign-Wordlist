The following package is the standalone wordlist-only component to 
[flask-unsign](https://github.com/Paradoxis/Flask-Unsign). The two parts are separated to prevent you from having to also download the rather bulky wordlists if you only want to use the code.

## Installation
To install the application, simply use pip:

```
$ pip install flask-unsign-wordlist
```

To install the tool for development purposes, run the following command (after downloading a copy):

```
$ pip install -e .[test]
```

## Usage

To use the wordlists, either download them directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/Paradoxis/Flask-Unsign-Wordlist/tree/master/flask_unsign_wordlist/wordlists) or install them with pip and either run the command line tool:

``` 
$ flask-unsign-wordlist
$ flask-unsign-wordlist <wordlist>
```

Or import the code in Python to get the path:

```python
import flask_unsign_wordlist
print(flask_unsign_wordlist.get('all'))
```
